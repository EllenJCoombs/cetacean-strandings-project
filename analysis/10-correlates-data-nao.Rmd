## Collecting North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) data for the model 
No prerequisites are required for this code to run. This code reads in NOA data from University Corporation for Atmospheric Research: https://climatedataguide.ucar.edu/sites/default/files/nao_station_annual.txt

## Load packages 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

## Load data 
This is in the raw data file, and does not require cleaning - it is a yearly NAO reading. 
```{r}
NAO_data <- read.csv("NAO_data.csv")
NAO_data$X <- NULL

#Rename the columns if required 
#NAO_data <- NAO_data %>%
  #dplyr::rename(NAO_index = n)

```
