## Running generalised additive models (GAMs) on stranding events 

This RMarkdown document shows the code for running some additional analysis for running GAMs for stranding events, rather than indivisual records (as in the main analyses). These models use the same covariates as in 12-generalised-additive-models.Rmd. 

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
