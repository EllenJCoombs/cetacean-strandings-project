## Collecting storms data for the model 
No prerequisites are required for this code to run. This code reads in, and cleans population data which will form part of the dataset of possible correlates of strandings. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

## Reading in the data
### Cleaning data 
These data come from the [Office of National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/) and various data sources (see supplementary material) - collected for 1913-2015
```{r}
#Population data UK
#Also in the "modelling' folder 
#This is a data file that is combined with yearly strandings 

Population <- read.csv("Population_UK.csv")
Population <- Population %>%
  rename(Year = YEAR) %>%
  rename(Population = POPULATION)

#Save data for pulling into final correlates dataset 
write.csv(Population, file = Population)

```
