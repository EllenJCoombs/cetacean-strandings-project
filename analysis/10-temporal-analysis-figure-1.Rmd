## Temporal strandings plot 

This markdown document requires the output from `03-final-data-clean.Rmd`. This code plots all cetacean strandings from 1913-2015 from the combined dataset (NHM + CSIP + IWDG) and produces Figure.1 from the paper. 


## Load packages 
```{r}
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(viridis)
```

## Including Plots


You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
