## Collecting storms data for the model 
No prerequisites are required for this code to run. This code reads in and cleans storm data which will form part of the dataset of possible correlates of strandings. 

## Load packages 
```{r}
library(dplyr)
```

## Load data 
This loads the raw storms data csv file 
```{r}
#Storm data 
#Read from "Modelling" folder 
storms <- read.csv("Storm_data.csv")
```

## Clean data 
```{r}
#Select data 
storms <- storms %>% 
  select(Year, Count)

#Counting up and keeping 0 as 0 
storms <- storms %>% 
  complete(Year, fill = list(Count = 0)) %>% 
  dplyr::group_by(Year) %>% 
  dplyr::summarise(count = sum(Count))

#Renaming count to storms 
Storms <- storms %>%
  rename(Storms = count)

#Save cleaned storms data 
write.csv(Storms, file = "Storm_data.csv")

```
