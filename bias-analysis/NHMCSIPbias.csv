Bias ,Bias effect ,Dealing with bias,Notes ,Dave's additions ,To do 
Validity of stranding data ,high,Linear regression ,Dead:Live. Pyenson (2010) and consult live survey data - Scotland ,Stranding data vs. live surveys - these should correlate ,Have a look at long running live survey data - as well as Norwegian whaling records (monthly may be available - ask David) 
Species bias ,high,SQS ,SQS and species accumulation curves (rarefaction) ,Rarer species such as the Beakers - think about mis-ID here as well.  Any temporal changes in the bias? This will surely mess things up ,Seasonal bias - is it species specific? Differences in species biology 
Time ,high,autocorrelation (time series) ,"Effects of temporal changes e.g. sampling effort, events ",,
Abundance bias ,high,Corrected ,The degree to which the presence of dead taxa are driven by their abundance. Divide by total number of records for that year  ,"Total dead by population total? This will probably be difficult for the older data. Not sure when we have models going back to for some of these species and ",Species ecology - important to think about the potential spatial extent of each  population/sub-population -- this has probably changed historically and that's tricky…
Dates ,high ,Sensitivity analysis ,All data vs. data after 1970 ,Working with the post-1970 data first as it might be better. (More of a proxy for a load of different stuff than bias) ,See how this is informed by exploratory plots of the sampling effort etc. for post-1970
Species identification ,high,Sensitivity analysis ,Remove unknowns ,Think about misidentification. ,When were species first indentified? Names/dates e.g. Beakers in the North Sea 
Who made the record ,medium ,Sensitivity analysis ??,Biases in citizen science - how is this accounted for? Might just have to be for the CSIP data as the NHM doesn't have recorder names ,,
Spatial - currents - geography ,medium ,Linear regression ,"E.g. currents and bathymetry causing differing rates of stranding  - Klinowska (1985), see 'Drift' bias below and Macleod et al (2004) ",,
Sampling effort ,medium ,Per unit population density ,Corrected over time: split into time bins (strandings per density calculation) ,We might be able to think of something else: whales don't care about counties…other papers split the UK into 7 sections ,"Other ways to split up the coastline - papers such as Macleod (2004, I think…)"
Ground truthing ,medium ,?,Strandings divided by known population at that time. Historical population density: whaling records (St. Andrews) ,,
Date certainty ,medium ,Sensitivity analysis ,Remove unknowns ,,
Sightings ,medium ,Regression ,Which species we see and which are sighted ,,
Bycatch,low ,Sensitivity analysis ,Look at historical bycatch - remove bycatch ,,
Stranding condition,low ,Sensitivity analysis ,Remove unknowns ,,
Drift ,low ,Regression ,Live (assuming actual location) vs decomposed strandings (possible drift)  - Klinowska (1985) ,,
Species ranges ,low ,Ground truthing ,OBIS-SEAMAP (extract CSIP) ,,
