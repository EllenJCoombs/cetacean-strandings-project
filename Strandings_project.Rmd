## R Markdown for stranding project 

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

## Data cleaning and binding 

1. Cleaning and standardising the Natural History Museum (NHM), Cetacean Stranding Investigation Programme (CSIP) and Irish Whale and Dolphin Group (IWDG) datasets for binding 
2. Binding the 3 datasets (NHM + CSIP first, followed by IWDG which was aquired at a later date)

## Temporal and spatial analysis and plotting 

1. Figure 1: Stranding events of cetacean species in UK and Irish waters from 1913-2015. The y axis shows the species found in the UK and Irish stranding records. 
2. Figure 2: Temporal and spatial variation in cetacean strandings records for all species, odontocetes (toothed whales), and mysticetes (baleen whales) in the waters around the UK and Ireland from 1913-2015. 

## Model creation 

1. Data collection for Generalised Additive Models (GAMs)
i. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) - ncdf file and maximum values 
ii. Geomagnetic data 
iii. North Atlantic Oscillation 
iv. Storms 
v. Population 
vi. Total strandings 

2. Creation of data table for model - bind 

## Generalised Additive Models 

1. Running GAMs for All_strandc (all records) and No_phocoena 
2. GAM code 


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
